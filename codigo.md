About Codigo
Codigo is a Solana AI development Platform that transforms ideas into secure, scalable dApps using specialized AI models. We are built by pioneers in AI x Crypto. We're excited to kick off Week 1 of a multi-week collaboration between Codigo and Superteam Nigeria! The Codigo DevQuest is a community-powered initiative designed to showcase the talent, creativity, and technical depth of builders across the Superteam Nigeria ecosystem, while also strengthening the ties between Codigo and the broader Solana developer community in Nigeria.

codigo.ai is the ONLY official website.

Mission
Build the full frontend for one of the five available templates in the Codigo free tier.

To get the template program, go at codigo.ai, create a free account, create a project and select a template (NFT Marketplace, Escrow, Associated Token Account, Escrow, Memo, Stake Pool)

Scope Detail
Choose one of the five templates available in the free tier on Codigo (NFT Marketplace, Escrow, Associated Token Account, Escrow, Memo, Stake Pool).

Build the complete frontend implementation of that template using React (not Next.js).

You can write the code manually, use an AI code editor, or combine both approaches. We encourage the use of AI-assisted workflows (e.g., Cursor, GPT-4, Claude, etc.).

Clean, complete, and functioning frontend code that matches the template and brings it to life.

Prompt history and AI tooling used should be submitted alongside your code, if AI was part of your process.

Submission Requirements
Your completed frontend code (GitHub or similar link).

Wallet address (to receive the prize if winner).

AI tool(s) used (if any).

Prompt history (if AI-assisted).
